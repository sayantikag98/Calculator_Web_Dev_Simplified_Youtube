My First Calculator Web Application - Concept taken from Web Dev Simplified YouTube Channel but code done myself

* This application has been made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. 
* In CSS I have used CSS Grid and Flexbox to make the layout.
* Used Javascript and DOM Manipulation to add functionality to the calculator.
