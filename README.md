My First Calculator Web Application - Concept taken from Web Dev Simplified YouTube Channel but code done myself

#This application has been made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
#In CSS I have used CSS Grid and Flexbox to make the layout.
#Used Javascript and DOM Manipulation to add functionality to the calculator.
